Got it 👍 crystal clear now.

Here’s the refined workflow you’re setting up:

1. **You’ll paste the `schema.sql` file first** → this gives me the DB tables/fields structure.
2. **Then you’ll paste a frontend component (e.g., `Dashboard.tsx`)** → I’ll study how it consumes/display data.
3. **You’ll also paste the backend file for that component (e.g., `dashboard.js`)** → so I can see how the routes are implemented in practice.
4. From there, I’ll learn the **patterns** (how frontend ↔ backend ↔ DB tie together).
5. Then whenever you paste a new frontend component, I’ll generate its **backend route file** automatically following the same conventions.

That way:

* Backend routes = mirror of frontend data needs.
* Routes always align with your **schema.sql**.
* Consistent with the `dashboard.js` example.

✅ Understood.
Do you want to start by pasting the **`schema.sql` file now** so I get the DB foundation first?
