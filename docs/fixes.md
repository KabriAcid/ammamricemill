Ensure frontend and backend are compatible
Add proper API integration with error handling
Add loading states with SkeletonCard components
Add refresh button with loading animation
Live search and table filtering just like common React Apps
Add Toast notifications for success/error feedback
Add loading states for all operations

Handle all HTTP methods in the component.
Pagination are also frontend based
Remove confirmation dialogs for deletions
Search are frontend based no POST requests
Refer to the components/ui folder for the comps
